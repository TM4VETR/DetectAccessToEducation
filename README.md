# Detect Access To Education 
A novel approach towards the automated detection of access to education and training in German training offers and advertisements.

# Background

The German labour market heavily relies on vocational education and training, re-training and advanced vocational qualification. To match training seekers and offers, we present a novel approach towards the automated detection of access to education and training in German training offers and advertisements. We will in particular focus on (a) general school and education degrees and school-leaving certificates, (b) professional experience, (c) a previous apprenticeship and (d) a list of skills.
